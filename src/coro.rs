/// A coroutine that can be resumed with an input value of type `I`, returning
/// a suspended state that either "yields" a value of type `Y` or "returns" a
/// value of type `R`.
///
/// Unlike `std::ops::Coroutine`, the Rust standard library's coroutine
/// trait, this trait's `resume()` method consumes the coroutine. It gives the
/// caller a new coroutine instance to continue `resume()`-ing *only* if the
/// coroutine yielded a value. If the coroutine returned instead, no new
/// coroutine is provided back to the caller, so it is impossible to continue
/// the coroutine after it has returned.
///
/// Contrast this with `Iterator`, which lets you call `next()` as many
/// times as you want, even after it has returned `None`. Implementers of
/// `Iterator` are expected to return `None` every time after they have once
/// returned `None`, but there is no way to enforce this in the type system.
/// Meanwhile, consumers of `Iterator`s tend not to test for cases where the
/// iterators they are given violate this contract. This can lead to subtle bugs
/// that are difficult to track down.
///
/// The `std::iter` library provides the `Iterator::fuse()` method and the
/// `FusedIterator` trait to attempt to mitigate these risks, but there is no
/// substitute for type safety. The `Coro` trait is an experiment in using move
/// semantics to enforce the contracts implicit in the design of `Coroutine` and
/// similar traits like `Iterator` and `Future`.
///
/// Note that with this design, we don't need to use `Pin` at all, the way that
/// `std::ops::Coroutine` and `std::future::Future` do. `Coro`
/// implementations are not constructed with language-native features like
/// generator or async blocks. Instead, this library provides ways to create
/// rich, expressive coroutines using normal closures and combinators,
/// avoiding the need for self-referential data structures.
///
/// `cocoro` coroutines tend to be constructed by either implementing `Coro` for
/// a type, or, more commonly, by using functions like `yield_with()` or
/// `just_yield()` and chaining combinators like `map_yield()` and
/// `map_return()`.
