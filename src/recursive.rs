/// Creates a coroutine using a recursive function.
///
/// The function takes a wrapper of a reference to itself alongside the input
/// type to the coroutine, and returns either `Yield` with a yielded value and
/// the recursive wrapper, or `Return` with the return value.
///
/// The function must be `'static` because it is referenced as a trait object
/// to get around the limitations of
/// <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/97680>. Rust does not allow
/// closure objects to take themselves, or types that own references to
/// themselves, as inputs. However, it is possible for a closure to take a
/// reference to a `dyn Fn` object that happens to be itself.
///
/// This is also why `f` is passed by reference: the wrapped closure object must
/// not own the `Fn` because it must pass "itself" (actually a copy that wraps
/// the same reference to the `Fn`) to the function, and if the wrapper were to
/// own the `Fn`, then it would be impossible to invoke the `Fn` with the value
/// after the wrapper had been constructed.
///
/// Whereas `yield_with()` is useful for infinite coroutines that never return,
/// and `from_fn()` is useful for guaranteed-finite coroutines that must return
/// within a knowable finite number of steps, `recursive()` is useful for
/// creating coroutines that may return, but without a finite bound known at
/// compile time.
///
/// The result of `recursive()` is a `FixedPointCoro`, which means that its
/// `Next` type is itself. This allows the coroutine to be looped over
/// iteratively without recursion, by assigning the result of `resume()` back to
/// the coroutine variable when the `Suspend` result matches `Yield`. It also
/// enables methods like `into_iter()` when the input type `I` implements
/// `Default`.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use cocoro::{recursive, Coro, Return, Void, Yield};
///
/// recursive(&|recur, n| Yield(n + 1, recur))
///     .returns::<Void>()
///     .assert_yields(1, 0)
///     .assert_yields(2, 1)
///     .assert_yields(3, 2);
/// ```
